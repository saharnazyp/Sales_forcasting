# 📈 Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project focuses on forecasting sales using machine learning techniques in Python.  
The goal is to analyze historical sales data, preprocess it, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance to make accurate sales predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine Learning model training
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Sales prediction visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
📊 Workflow

Load and explore the dataset

Clean and preprocess the data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Train machine learning models

Evaluate model performance

Generate sales forecasts

📈 Results

The notebook demonstrates how machine learning models can be used to predict future sales based on historical data.
Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics and visualized for better interpretation.

🧠 Future Improvements

Add more advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM, Prophet)

Hyperparameter tuning

Cross-validation

Deploy the model as a web app (e.g., Streamlit or FastAPI)
